### 🧠 Emotion Detection from Text — Powered by LLMs

> **Understand human emotions through language.**
> A modern NLP pipeline that classifies emotions in text using a powerful fine-tuned transformer model. Designed for real-world applications like chatbots, mental health assistants, and social media monitoring.

---

### 🚀 Features

* 🧠 Uses Hugging Face's `distilbert-base-uncased` for emotion classification.
* 📊 Preprocessed using advanced NLP techniques: tokenization, label encoding, and padding.
* 🔍 Supports multi-emotion classification: Happy, Sad, Anger, Fear, Surprise, Neutral.
* 📈 High validation accuracy with clean training and loss curves.
* ⚙️ Easily pluggable into any backend system (API-ready structure).
* 📁 Well-documented Jupyter notebook — clear, step-by-step walkthrough.

### 📁 File Structure

```
📦 Emotion Detection Project
 ┣ 📜 Sentiment_analysis.ipynb      # Main notebook for model training and evaluation
 ┣ 📂 model/                        # (Optional) Saved tokenizer/model weights
 ┗ 📄 README.md                     # You're here!
```

### 🧪 Model Workflow

1. **Data Preprocessing**

   * Clean, lowercase, remove noise.
   * Encode emotion labels.
   * Tokenize using `DistilBERTTokenizer`.

2. **Model**

   * Transformer-based text classification using `DistilBERTForSequenceClassification`.

3. **Training & Evaluation**

   * Trained using PyTorch & Hugging Face `Trainer`.
   * Monitored using accuracy and loss curves.
   * Final model can classify emotions with high confidence.

4. **Sample Output**

   > "I just got promoted!" → **Emotion: Joy**
   > "I can’t take this anymore." → **Emotion: Sadness**
